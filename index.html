        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a student at the University of California, Riverside. I am studying Business with the concentration of finance. I aspire to work in investment banking. I have experience working with marketing and retail. I worked at Zara and Target and gained a lot of marketing experience and good insight about how business works. <br><br>

        I also am into fitness and am studying to become a personal trainer. I plan to first work at public gyms as a personal trainer and create my own business online for personal training. I plan to start my own business one day. I am really passionate about fitness. Working out at the gym has been a meaningful part of my self-love and self-growth. 
<br><br>

        I have experience in the medical field as well and dealing with patients. I volunteered at a pediatric clinic and gained a lot of experience checking vitals, recording documents, organizing files, dealing with health insurance, scheduling appointments, and getting exposed to the medical, fast pasted environment. I also volunteered to help perform exercise activities with patients with Alzheimer's disease. I have a lot of experience handling people. I am great with communication and have great patience when dealing with clients. I grew up with a lot of interests in mind. I have passion for people, health, fitness, businesses, marketing, and travel. College really changed me and my mindset about everything. I went through many phases and trying to discover who i am. Because of college, I decided that I ultimately wanted to major in business. This is a very useful degree that I can utilize in anything. I decided that I want to get into investment banking because it is a great way to start valuation and financial modeling work as it gives an opportunity to become an expert at building large, complex financial models. This can be an excellent way to start my career as we spend a lot of time on valuation work. I think it is really cool how analysts and associates have the opportunity to work on building various types of financial models for important transactions. I like how in investment banking, the training you receive is extensive and will never end so I will have a real chance of improving, getting better and better as time goes on. Also, as an investment banker, I will get the chance to develop an entire array of skills that ranges from accounting and financing. Also in skills of   networking and people skills. Which I already have a lot people skills. This job will prove efficient and highly useful to me if I ever decide to change my line of work at some point because this job can open many doors and meet really cool, ambitious people. Investment banking is definitely something I will do and pursue while I also do personal training because fitness is a side passion of mine and I aspire to work and grow as a person with my skills and get involved in the investment banking industry.
